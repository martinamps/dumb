# World's Dumbest Website: Project Plan

## Project Overview

Creating an intentionally terrible website for worldsdumbestdomain.com as part of the "World's Dumbest Hackathon". The site aims to provide a hilariously frustrating user experience through intentionally poor design choices and useless features.

## Core Site Layout

- **Main Pane**: Features the horoscope selector and horoscope-based CAPTCHA challenge
- **Right Side Panel**: Contains three widgets:
  - Dumb Haiku (implemented)
  - Dramatically Overreacted Weather (implemented)
  - Stock Market Emoji Translator (implemented)

## Feature Progress

### Implemented Features:

- [x] Basic site structure and layout
- [x] Cloudflare Workers AI integration
- [x] Dumb Haiku generator in right panel
- [x] Useless "Generate New Haiku" button (shows confirm dialog with "nah" and "nvm" options that do nothing)
- [x] Dramatically Overreacted Weather widget
  - [x] Multiple approaches to determine user's location:
    - [x] AI-powered city guessing based on browser information (20% chance)

    - [x] Random chance to add fictional descriptors (like "Quantum" or "Haunted") to city names
    - [x] Includes city country in display for extra authenticity
  - [x] Semi-realistic weather simulation:
    - [x] Season-aware temperature generation based on location
    - [x] Different temperature ranges for continental vs. coastal/island locations
    - [x] Temperature-appropriate weather conditions (e.g., snow for cold, storms for hot)
    - [x] Displays "real" weather data with strikethrough and disclaimer
  - [x] Absurdly calculated temperature with numerous factors:
    - [x] Time of day (hours, minutes, and seconds)
    - [x] City name length and country first letter influence
    - [x] User agent length contributes to temperature
    - [x] Lunar cycle influence and "cosmic rays"
  - [x] Highly detailed and bizarre weather conditions:
    - [x] Location-based modifiers for real weather conditions
    - [x] Ridiculous humidity and wind descriptions

    - [x] Manual refresh button
    - [x] Temperature-specific emoji indicator
- [x] Stock Market Emoji Translator widget
  - [x] Five ridiculous methods for stock selection:
    - [x] WayBack Machine Method: Stocks based on a "2008 investing forum thread"
    - [x] Fortune Cookie Method: Selected using fictional horoscope
    - [x] Geo-Unlucky Method: Shows stocks from opposite timezone
    - [x] Trend-Adjacent Method: Shows tickers alphabetically adjacent to trending ones
    - [x] Sentimental Favorites: Based on letters in your browser's "name"
  - [x] Real stock market data integration:
    - [x] Uses Yahoo Finance API to fetch real stock prices
    - [x] In-memory caching to reduce API calls
    - [x] Fallback to generated prices when real data unavailable
    - [x] "REAL" indicator for actual market data
  - [x] Absurd emoji translation system:
    - [x] First emoji based on company name's first letter
    - [x] Second emoji based on stock movement (exaggerated)
    - [x] Third emoji based on stock price last digit
    - [x] Fourth emoji based on current phase of the moon
    - [x] Random bonus emoji for no reason
  - [x] Interactive features:
