# World's Dumbest Domain

Welcome to the repository for [worldsdumbestdomain.com](https://worldsdumbestdomain.com), created for the "World's Dumbest Hackathon" where we build intentionally terrible experiences.

## Project Overview

This website is designed to be frustrating, absurd, and completely useless - exactly as intended! We're building a collection of the worst UX patterns we can imagine, wrapped in a visually appealing but fundamentally broken interface.

## Core Features

### Main Pane
- **Horoscope Selector**: Choose your zodiac sign through an intentionally terrible interface
- **Horoscope-Based CAPTCHA**: Solve absurd verification challenges based on your horoscope

### Right Side Panel
- **Dumb Haiku**: AI-generated haikus about dumb domain names (with a button that does nothing)
- **Dramatically Overreacted Weather**: Weather forecasts that treat every condition like a catastrophe
- **Stock Market Emoji Translator**: Converts real and made-up financial data into completely unhelpful emoji sequences with arbitrary translation rules

## Product Experience

### Horoscope Selector Ideas
- Constellation Connect-the-Dots with a shaky cursor
- Zodiac Wheel of Misfortune that never quite stops on your sign
- Astrological Slider with all 12 signs crammed into a tiny arc
- Star Sign Memory Match with randomly shuffling cards
- Birth Month Calculator that uses completely wrong calculations

### Horoscope-Based CAPTCHA Examples
- For Aries: "Click on all images that show people taking calculated risks according to actuarial tables"
- For Taurus: "Slide this bar to exactly represent your financial stability"
- For Gemini: "Type this sentence backward while answering unrelated math questions"

### Pessimized Horoscope Delivery
- Real horoscopes transformed into hilariously pessimistic versions
- Random "glitches" revealing even worse predictions
- Oddly specific yet universally applicable details

## Technical Details

- Built with React Router on Cloudflare Workers
- Uses Cloudflare AI for generating content
- Styled with TailwindCSS
- Modular API architecture with separate route handlers
